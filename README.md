## Methodology Recommendation
Scrum - to ensure flexibility, transparency, and incremental delivery.

## Suggested KPis
Tank autonomy (days until 20% capacity) - helps anticipate when stocks are about to run out, enabling proactive restocking and preventing unexpected downtime.

Chemical consumption rate by well - lets you monitor how much chemical each well uses individually, which helps detect inefficiencies, abnormal consumption or wells needing special attention.

Injection rate - facilitates optimization and cost control, helps prevent operational issues

Site-level chemical usage efficiency -to minimizing waste, reducing costs and ensuring optimal dosing.

Equipment utilization indicator - tracks how well the injection equipment is used (pumps, tanks, pipelines), enabling better maintenance planning, asset utilization and reliability of the system

## My Experience 

Creating this system was a real challenge. I had to learn about the chemical injection system, write a readme for the first time and research tools to help me complete this task in a short time. The challenge made me learn many things quickly. Despite the pressure and limited guidance, I remained self-organized and delivered the project. The experience taught me many things fast and showed that I can adapt, learn new concepts, and work under tight deadlines, qualities I believe match what this position requires.
