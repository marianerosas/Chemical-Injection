## My Experience 

Creating this system was a real challenge. I had to learn about the chemical injection system, write a readme for the first time and research tools to help me complete this task in a short time. The challenge made me learn many things quickly. Despite the pressure and limited guidance, I remained self-organized and delivered the project. The experience taught me many things fast and showed that I can adapt, learn new concepts, and work under tight deadlines, qualities I believe match what this position requires.
